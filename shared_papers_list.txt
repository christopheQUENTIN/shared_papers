Abstract

The use of growth factors is considered to be one of the promising therapeutic strategies for multiple sclerosis (MS). Various studies have shown that platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a bioproduct of concentrated platelets, contains a variety of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epithelial growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). The therapeutic roles of PRP, with regard to a wide range of growth factors, on the nervous system have been shown in a limited number of studies. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of PRP in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. PRP was prepared and intrathecally injected into the EAE mice. The EAE scoring test, the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) test, luxol fast blue and hematoxylin and eosin staining, real-time PCR, and western blotting were used for studying the effect of PRP on the motosensory function, remyelination, inflammatory cell infiltration, gliosis, and inflammatory cytokines expression. PRP administration in treated animals improved the functional abilities, remyelination, and oligodendrogenesis compared to the EAE mice. Furthermore, high numbers of microglia, astrocytes and infiltrating inflammatory cells and also the expression of proinflammatory cytokines were reversed after PRP therapy. In conclusion, these data suggest the PRP as a potential candidate for MS treatment.

Abstract

Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition that primarily manifests as demyelination of neuronal axons in the central nervous system, due to the loss or attack of oligodendroglia cells that form myelin. Stem cell therapy has shown promising results for the treatment of MS due to its capability to halt the immune attack, stop apoptosis and axonal degeneration, and differentiate into oligodendrocytes. Stem cell-derived Exosomes (Exosomes) have shown great capabilities for neuronal diseases as they have growth factors, complex sets of miRNA, enzymes, proteins, major peptides, lipids, and macromolecules with anti-inflammatory, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis activities.

Methods: This study aimed to compare the healing properties of stem cells, against Exosomes for the treatment of an experimentally induced MS dog model. Dog models of MS received either a single treatment of stem cells or a single treatment of Exosomes intrathecally and the treatment process was evaluated clinically, radiologically, histopathologically, and electron microscopy and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.

Results: showed marked amelioration of the clinical signs in both treated groups compared to the control one, magnetic resonance scans showed the resolution of the hyperintense lesions at the end of the study period, the histopathology and electron microscopy showed marked healing properties and remyelination in treated groups with superiority of the stem cells compared to Exosomes.

Conclusions: Although stem cell results were superior to Exosomes therapy; Exosomes have proven to be effective and safe important actors in myelin regeneration, and their use in diseases like MS helps to stimulate remyelination.

Abstract

Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. To date, there is no effective therapy for it. Our study aimed to determine the potential role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of MS in cats.

Methods: The current study was conducted on 15 adult Persian cats that were divided into three groups: control negative, control positive (ethidium bromide (EB)-treated group), and PRP co-treated group (EB-treated group intrathecally injected with PRP on day 14 post-spinal cord injury). PRP was obtained by centrifuging blood on anticoagulant citrate dextrose and activating it with red and green laser diodes. The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scores were used to assess the motor function recovery on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 20, and 28 following 14 days from EB injection. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, histopathological investigations, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies, and immunohistochemical analysis were conducted, and the gene expressions of nerve growth factors (NGFs), brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), and stromal cell-derived factors (SDF) were evaluated.

Results: Our results indicated that PRP had a significant ameliorative effect on the motor function of the hindlimbs as early as day 20 and so on. MRI revealed that the size and intensity of the lesion were significantly reduced in the PRP co-treated group. The histopathological and TEM investigations demonstrated that the PRP co-treated group had a significant improvement in the structure and organization of the white matter, as well as a high remyelination capacity. Furthermore, a significant increase in myelin basic protein and Olig2 immunoreactivity as well as a reduction in Bax and glial fibrillar acidic protein immune markers was observed. NGFs were found to be upregulated by gene expression.

Conclusion: As a result, we concluded that the intrathecal injection of PRP was an effective, safe, and promising method for the treatment of MS.

Abstract

Serotonin (5-HT) is a key neurotransmitter synthesized both in the gut and the central nervous system. It exerts its signaling through specific receptors (5-HTR), which regulate numerous behaviors and functions such as mood, cognitive function, platelet aggregation, gastrointestinal motility, and inflammation. Serotonin activity is determined mainly by the extracellular availability of 5-HT, which is controlled by the serotonin transporter (SERT). Recent studies indicate that, by activation of innate immunity receptors, gut microbiota can modulate serotonergic signaling by SERT modulation. As part of its function, gut microbiota metabolize nutrients from diet to produce different by-products, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs): propionate, acetate, and butyrate. However, it is not known whether these SCFAs regulate the serotonergic system. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of SCFAs on the gastrointestinal serotonergic system using the Caco-2/TC7 cell line that expresses SERT and several receptors constitutively. Cells were treated with different SCFAs concentrations, and SERT function and expression were evaluated. In addition, the expression of 5-HT receptors 1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, 4, and 7 was also studied. Our results show that the microbiota-derived SCFAs regulate intestinal serotonergic system, both individually and in combination, modulating the function and expression of SERT and the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT7 receptors expression. Our data highlight the role of gut microbiota in the modulation of intestinal homeostasis and suggest microbiome modulation as a potential therapeutic treatment for intestinal pathologies and neuropsychiatric disorders involving serotonin.

Abstract

Background: Mitochondria play a critical role in the production of cell energy and the regulation of cell death. Therefore, mitochondria orchestrate numerous cell effector functions, including fine-tuning the immune system. While mitochondria are mainly found intracellularly, they can escape the confine of the cell during the process of extracellular vesicle release. Platelets patrol blood vessels to ensure vasculature integrity and to support the immune system. In blood, platelets are the primary source of circulating mitochondria. Activated platelets produce extracellular vesicles, including a subset of mitochondria-containing vesicles.

Study design and methods: We characterized mitochondrial functions in platelet-derived extracellular vesicles, and examined whether they could impact the bioenergetics of cellular immune recipients using an extracellular flux analyzer to measure real-time bioenergetics.

Results: We validated that extracellular vesicles derived from activated platelets contain the necessary mitochondrial machinery to respirate and generate energy. Moreover, neutrophils and monocytes efficiently captured platelet-derived extracellular vesicles, enhancing their mitochondrial fitness. This process required functional mitochondria from donor platelets, as it was abolished by the inactivation of extracellular mitochondria using mitochondrial poison.

Discussion: Together, the data suggest that extracellular mitochondria produced by platelets may support other metabolic functions through transcellular bioenergetics.

Conclusions

Allogeneic clinical-grade PCs collected from repeat healthy blood donors by licensed blood establishments represent a readily available source of therapeutic cells, which, when not used to cover the needs for hospital transfusion, can serve rapidly growing clinical needs for cell therapy, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery. The beneficial use of allogeneic platelets in these therapeutic domains is currently illustrated by the demonstration that HPL is a safe and potent xeno-free substitute for FBS as a growth medium supplement for the clinical-grade expansion of human cells for transplantation, primarily MSCs, and potentially others like chondrocytes, DCs, or CAR-T cells. Currently, the use of allogeneic PCs as source material for the preparation of HPLs for direct clinical use is still at a relatively early stage; however, recent developments are demonstrating that allogeneic HPLs are a viable and safe alternative to traditional serum eye drops for the treatment of ocular surface disorders, including dry eye syndrome. One can logically anticipate that future preclinical and clinical studies will examine the possibility of using allogeneic HPLs in other degenerative pathologies such as treating recalcitrant skin wounds and degenerative joints, and even as biotherapy to modulate neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. When considering such applications in regenerative medicine, it will remain vital to develop dedicated and standardized HPL preparations, which through careful scientifically based in vitro characterization and well-designed preclinical and clinical evaluations are demonstrated to be safe and best fit the clinical specificities of the pathology addressed for optimal efficacy. In this manuscript, we also highlighted the exciting potential offered by allogeneic PCs and HPLs as source materials, complementary to MSCs, for the isolation of various types of pooled p-EV preparations as subcellular therapeutic modalities for regenerative medicine or as vehicles for drug delivery. Establishing p-EVs as a recognized therapy requires, as for most EV sources [356], the resolution of various manufacturing and regulatory challenges. Challenges include, among others, the development of reliable and dedicated p-EV generation and downstream purification processes, including pathogen-reduction treatments, the capacity to provide suitable biochemical characterization of the molecular cargo and mechanism of action and/or targeting, the development of meaningful quality control assays to guarantee batch-to-batch consistency, safety, and efficacy, and the implementation of meaningful preclinical tests relevant to targeted clinical indications. In conclusion, we believe that allogeneic platelet-derived preparations are likely to have an increasingly prominent position in the future among the arsenal of biotherapies available for cell therapy, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery.

 Abstract

Recently, gene therapy has become a subject of considerable research and has been widely evaluated in various disease models. Though it is considered as a stand-alone agent for COVID-19 vaccination, gene therapy is still suffering from the following drawbacks during its translation from the bench to the bedside: the high sensitivity of exogenous nucleic acids to enzymatic degradation; the severe side effects induced either by exogenous nucleic acids or components in the formulation; and the difficulty to cross the barriers before reaching the therapeutic target. Therefore, for the successful application of gene therapy, a safe and reliable transport vector is urgently needed. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are the ideal candidate for the delivery of gene drugs owing to their low immunogenicity, good biocompatibility and low toxicity. To better understand the properties of EVs and their advantages as gene drug delivery vehicles, this review covers from the origin of EVs to the methods of EVs generation, as well as the common methods of isolation and purification in research, with their pros and cons discussed. Meanwhile, the engineering of EVs for gene drugs is also highlighted. In addition, this paper also presents the progress in the EVs-mediated delivery of microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, messenger RNAs, plasmids, and antisense oligonucleotides. We believe this review will provide a theoretical basis for the development of gene drugs.
