Abstract

Introduction: Sepsis is an infection-induced severe inflammatory disorder leading to multiple organ dysfunction. It remains a highly lethal condition for which early diagnosis and therapy achieve unsatisfactory results. Circulating exosomes containing biomarkers and mediators of sepsis have recently received attention, but the progress has been far from optimal.

Objectives: The present study focuses on the profiles of molecular dynamics in serum exosomes and explores the potential molecular mechanisms on serum exosomes during the process of sepsis.

Methods: We used high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and RNA-seq to detect the dynamic profiles of exosome proteins and RNAs (including mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs) in serum exosomes from 3 healthy individuals and 9 septic patients at the different stages. Then integrative multiomics analyses were performed and the results were validated by qRT-PCR, LiquiChip assay and metabolomics analysis on mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) modeling.

Results: A total of 354 proteins, 195 mRNAs, 82 lncRNAs and 55 miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed molecules in serum exosomes from septic patients. Integrative multiomics analysis showed that exosome components were associated with cytokine storm, complement and clotting cascades, the endothelial barrier, 20S proteasome-dependent protein degradation and vitamin metabolism. Importantly, pretreatment with serum exosomes derived from mice subjected to CLP significantly restrained proinflammatory cytokine expression and alleviated tissue injury in septic mice. Further metabolomics analysis demonstrated that pretreatment with septic serum exosomes significantly affected the metabolites associated with vitamin digestion and absorption in CLP mice.

Conclusion: Our study for the first time describes the landscape of the molecular dynamics of serum exosomes during the development of sepsis and proposes some hypothetical molecular mechanisms by integrative multiomics analysis, which may provide helpful diagnostic and therapeutic insights for the ongoing battle against sepsis.

Abstract

Accumulation of obsolete biomolecules can accelerate cell senescence and organism aging. The two efficient intracellular systems, namely the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome system, play important roles in dealing with cellular wastes. However, how multicellular organisms orchestrate the processing of obsolete molecules and delay aging remains unclear. Herein, it is shown that prevention of exosome release by GW4869 or Rab27a-/- accelerated senescence in various cells and mice, while stimulating exosome release by nutrient restriction delays aging. Interestingly, exosomes isolate from serum-deprived cells or diet-restricted human plasma, enriched with garbage biomolecules, including misfolded proteins, oxidized lipids, and proteins. These cellular wastes can be englobed by macrophages, eventually, for disintegration in vivo. Inhibition of nutrient-sensing mTORC1 signaling increases exosome release and delays senescence, while constitutive activation of mTORC1 reduces exosome secretion and exacerbates senescence in vitro and in mice. Notably, inhibition of exosome release attenuates nutrient restriction- or rapamycin-delayed senescence, supporting a key role for exosome secretion in this process. This study reveals a potential mechanism by which stimulated exosome release delays aging in multicellular organisms, by orchestrating the harmful biomolecules disposal via exosomes and macrophages.

Keywords: aging; exosomes; mTORC1; nutrient restriction; obsolete biomolecules.

Abstract

Background: Exosomes are emerging as important mediators of the cross-talk between tumor cells and the microenvironment. The communication between tumor-derived exosomes and macrophages has a critical role in facilitating tumor progression. However, the mechanisms by which exosomes modulate tumor development in lung cancer are not fully understood.

Methods: Short hairpin RNA mediated knockdown or exogenous expression of TRIM59 combined with in vitro and in vivo assays were performed to prove the functional significance of TRIM59. Western blotting, real-time PCR, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence (IF) staining assays, proximity ligation assay (PLA), ubiquitination assays, lactate secretion and lipid droplets content measurement, and rescue experiments were used to evaluate the mechanism. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected via subcutaneously or tail vein into C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice to assess the role of TRIM59 in vivo.

Results: We demonstrated that tripartite motif-containing 59 (TRIM59) was expressed in lung cancer cells-derived exosomes, and can be transferred to macrophages through the exosomes. Activated macrophages by TRIM59 promote lung cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that TRIM59 physically interacts with abhydrolase domain containing 5 (ABHD5) and directly induced the ubiquitination of ABHD5 and led to its proteasome-dependent degradation. ABHD5, an lipolytic co-activator, deficiency induced metabolic reprogramming and enabled NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Further studies showed that the exacerbation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by ABHD5 deficiency, provides a positive feedback loop to promote cancer progression by preferentially secrete the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β.

Conclusions: Collectively, these data indicate that tumor-derived exosomal TRIM59 converts macrophages to tumor-promoting functions of macrophages via regulating ABHD5 proteasomal degradation, to activate NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway to promote lung cancer progression by IL-1β secretion. Our findings also indicate that tumor-derived exosomal TRIM59 has an important role in intercellular communication for fostering an inflammatory microenvironment and promoting lung metastasis.

Keywords: ABHD5; Exosomes; Lung cancer; Macrophages; NLRP3; TRIM59.

Abstract

Background & aims: In eukaryotes, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway are essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis and associated with cancer progression. Our previous studies have demonstrated that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers, limits proteasome abundance and determines chemosensitivity to proteasome inhibitors in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). However, whether PTEN regulates the lysosome pathway remains unclear.

Methods: We tested the effects of PTEN on lysosome biogenesis and exosome secretion using loss- and gain-of-function strategies in CCA cell lines. Using in vitro dephosphorylation assays, we explored the regulatory mechanism between PTEN and the key regulator of lysosome biogenesis, transcription factor EB (TFEB). Using the migration assays, invasion assays, and trans-splenic liver metastasis mouse models, we evaluated the function of PTEN deficiency, TFEB-mediated lysosome biogenesis, and exosome secretion on tumor metastasis. Moreover, we investigated the clinical significance of PTEN expression and exosome secretion by retrospective analysis.

Results: PTEN facilitated lysosome biogenesis and acidification through its protein phosphatase activity to dephosphorylate TFEB at Ser211. Notably, PTEN deficiency increased exosome secretion by reducing lysosome-mediated degradation of multi-vesicular bodies, which further facilitated the proliferation and invasion of CCA. TFEB agonist curcumin analog C1 restrained the metastatic phenotype caused by PTEN deficiency in mouse models, and we highlighted the correlation between PTEN deficiency and exosome secretion in clinical cohorts.

Conclusions: In CCA, PTEN deficiency impairs lysosome biogenesis to facilitate exosome secretion and cancer metastasis in a TFEB phosphorylation-dependent manner.

Abstract

The structure and function of polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) and the exosome, as well as their associated RNA-helicases proteins, are described in the light of recent studies. The picture raised is of an evolutionarily conserved RNA-degradation machine which exonucleolytically degrades RNA from 3' to 5'. In prokaryotes and in eukaryotic organelles, a trimeric complex of PNPase forms a circular doughnut-shaped structure, in which the phosphorolysis catalytic sites are buried inside the barrel-shaped complex, while the RNA binding domains create a pore where RNA enters, reminiscent of the protein degrading complex, the proteasome. In some archaea and in the eukaryotes, several different proteins form a similar circle-shaped complex, the exosome, that is responsible for 3' to 5' exonucleolytic degradation of RNA as part of the processing, quality control, and general RNA degradation process. Both PNPase in prokaryotes and the exosome in eukaryotes are found in association with protein complexes that notably include RNA helicase.

The Escherichia coli RNA degradosome: structure, function and relationship in other ribonucleolytic multienzyme complexes

    PMID: 12035760 

Abstract

mRNA instability is an intrinsic property that permits timely changes in gene expression by limiting the lifetime of a transcript. The RNase e of Escherichia coli is a single-strand-specific endo-nuclease involved in the processing of rRNA and the degradation of mRNA. A nucleolytic multi-enzyme complex now known as the RNA degradosome was discovered during the purification and characterization of RNase E. Two other components are a 3' exoribonuclease (polynucleotide phosphorylase, PNPase) and a DEAD-box RNA helicase (RNA helicase B, RhlB). RNase E is a large multidomain protein with N-terminal ribonucleolytic activity, an RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal "scaffold" that binds PNPase, enolase and RhlB. RhlB by itself has little activity but is strongly stimiulated by its interaction with RNase E. RhlB in vitro can facilitate the degradation of structured RNA by PNPase. Since the discovery of the RNA degradosome in E. coli, related complexes have been described in other organisms.

Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge, demanding researchers address different approaches in relation to prevention, diagnostics and therapeutics. Amongst the many tactics of tackling these therapeutic challenges, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) or exosomes are emerging as a new frontier in the field of ameliorating viral infections. Exosomes are part of extracellular vesicles (EVs)-spherical biological structures with a lipid bilayer of a diameter of up to 5000 nm, which are released into the intercellular space by most types of eukaryotic cells, both in physiological and pathological states. EVs share structural similarities to viruses, such as small size, common mechanisms of biogenesis and mechanisms for cell entry. The role of EVs in promoting the viral spread by evading the immune response of the host, which is exhibited by retroviruses, indicates the potential for further investigation and possible manipulation of these processes when tackling the spread and treatment of COVID-19. The following paper introduces the topic of the use of exosomes in the treatment of viral infections, and presents the future prospects for the use of these EVs.

Abstract

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are used in many of the current stem cell-based clinical trials and their therapeutic efficacy has increasingly been attributed to secretion of paracrine factors. We have previously demonstrated that a therapeutic constituent of this secretion is exosome, a secreted bilipid membrane vesicle of ~50-100 nm with a complex cargo that is readily internalized by H9C2 cardiomyocytes. It reduces infarct size in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. We postulate that this therapeutic efficacy is derived from the synergy of a select permutation of individual exosome components. To identify protein candidates in this permutation, the proteome was profiled and here we identified 20S proteasome as a protein candidate. Mass spectrometry analysis detected all seven α and seven β chains of the 20S proteasome, and also the three beta subunits of "immunoproteasome" with a very high confidence level. We demonstrated that a functional proteasome copurified with MSC exosomes with a density of 1.10-1.18 g/mL, and its presence correlated with a modest but significant reduction in oligomerized protein in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. Circulating proteasomes in human blood also copurified with exosomes. Therefore, 20S proteasome is a candidate exosome protein that could synergize with other constituents to ameliorate tissue damage.

Abstract

Exosomes are released membrane vesicles derived from late endosomes, which share structural and biochemical characteristics with proteasomes. Exosomes are responsible for trafficking proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) among cells and regulating various cellular processes, such as differentiation, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Although our knowledge of the roles of exosomes in the initiation and progression of leukemia is limited, some studies have indicated that exosomes can encompass many functional factors with an appropriate sorting signal, thereby supporting the metastasis, drug resistance, and immune escape of leukemia cells. This review initially focuses on the biogenesis and composition of exosomes and then summarizes the application of exosomes as a screening biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in leukemia. Many recent reports on the functions of exosomes released from leukemia cells are also discussed, including drug resistance, immune dysfunction, and microenvironment manipulation. Given the critical roles of exosomes in leukemia, understanding the mechanisms regulating the compositions and levels of exosomes, as well as defining exosome functions, will ultimately provide additional insights into the use of exosomes as therapeutic agents for leukemia treatment.

Abstract

Exosomes are directly involved in governing of physiological and pathological conditions of an organism through the transfer of information from producing to receiving cells. It can be assumed that exosomes are one of the key players of tumor dissemination since they are very stable and small enough to penetrate from various tissues into biological fluids and then back, thus interacting with tissue target cells. We evaluated the enzymatic activity and the level of 20S proteasome in tissue and exosomes of healthy females (n = 39) and patients with ovarian (n = 50) and breast (n = 108) tumors to reveal the critical role of exosomal cargo in the mediation of different types of metastases. Exosomes from plasma and ascites were isolated and characterized in according to International Society for Extracellular Vesicles guidelines. The level of 20S proteasome in tissue and exosomes was determined using Western blot analysis. Chymotrypsin- and caspase-like (ChTL and CL, respectively) peptidase activities of the proteasomes were determined using fluorogenic Suc-LLVY-AMC and Cbz-LLG-AMC substrates, respectively. We observed increased levels of 20S proteasome in ovarian cancer tissue and luminal B subtype breast cancer tissue as well as in plasma exosomes from cancer patients. Moreover, the level of the 20S proteasome in plasma exosomes and ascites exosomes in patients with ovarian tumors is comparable and higher in ovarian cancer patients with low volume ascites than in patients with moderate and high-volume ascites. We also found increased ChTL and CL activities in breast cancer and ovarian cancer tissues, as well as in peritoneal metastases in ovarian cancer, while proteasomal activity in exosomes from plasma of healthy females and all patients, as well as from ascites of ovarian tumor patients were lower than detection limit of assay. Thus, regardless of the type of tumor metastasis (lymphogenous or peritoneal), the exosomes of cancer patients were characterized by an increased level of 20S proteasome, which do not exhibit enzymatic activity.

Abstract

Lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) with acute or chronic rejection release circulating exosomes that mostly originate from donor lung tissue and express mismatched human leucocyte antigens (HLA) and lung-associated self-antigens (SAgs), Collagen-V and K alpha 1 Tubulin. During lung transplant (LTx), donor lungs often undergo injuries that increase the antigenicity of the transplanted organ. 30% of LTxRs also have pre-transplant antibodies (Abs) to HLA and lung SAgs, which may induce conditions that increase the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Post-transplant, some recipients experience de novo development of Abs to mismatched donor HLA (donor-specific antibody [DSA]) and Abs to lung SAgs, which have been implicated in CLAD pathogenesis. Because most LTxRs who develop DSA also develop Abs to SAgs, some have suggested a synergistic relationship between alloimmunity and autoimmunity in CLAD immunopathogenesis. These processes likely occur from stress-induced exosome release. Exosomes carry allo-antigens, lung SAgs, several micro RNAs, proteasome, co-stimulatory molecules, and pro-inflammatory transcription factors-resulting in efficient antigen presentation by direct, semidirect, and indirect pathways, leading to immune responses to both allo-antigens and lung-associated SAgs. This review summarizes recent findings on the role of exosomes, and processes triggering immune responses to allo-antigens and lung SAgs that ultimately culminate in CLAD.

Abstract

Objectives: Our study profiled the CD4 + T-cell-derived exosomes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using proteomics.

Methods: Proteomic analysis of CD4 + T-cell-derived exosomes was performed by tandem mass tags (TMT) combined with LC-MS/MS. We validated the most significantly upregulated and downregulated proteins using ELISA and WB.

Results: The proteomic results showed that there were 3 upregulated differentially expressed proteins and 31 downregulated differentially expressed proteins in the RA group. The results indicated that dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 3 (DPYSL3) was significantly upregulated in CD4 + T-cell-derived exosomes, whereas proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (PSME1) was significantly downregulated in the RA group. Bioinformatics analysis showed that proteins were enriched in "positive regulation of gene expression", "antigen processing and presentation", "acute-phase response" and "PI3K-AKT signaling" pathways. ELISA verified that compared to the control group, the RA group showed significant upregulation of DPYSL3, and downregulation of PSME1 in CD4 + T-cell-derived exosomes.

Conclusions: The proteomic analysis results of CD4 + T-cell-derived exosomes from patients with RA suggest that these differentially expressed proteins may be involved in RA pathogenesis. DPYSL3 and PSME1 may become useful biomarkers for RA.

Abstract

Introduction: Activated platelets shed microparticles from plasma membranes, but also release smaller exosomes from internal compartments. While microparticles participate in athero-thrombosis, little is known of exosomes in this process.

Materials & methods: Ex vivo biochemical experiments with human platelets and exosomes, and FeCl3 -induced murine carotid artery thrombosis.

Results: Both microparticles and exosomes were abundant in human plasma. Platelet-derived exosomes suppressed ex vivo platelet aggregation and reduced adhesion to collagen-coated microfluidic channels at high shear. Injected exosomes inhibited occlusive thrombosis in FeCl3 -damaged murine carotid arteries. Control platelets infused into irradiated, thrombocytopenic mice reconstituted thrombosis in damaged carotid arteries, but failed to do so after prior ex vivo incubation with exosomes.CD36 promotes platelet activation, and exosomes dramatically reduced platelet CD36.CD36 is also expressed by macrophages, where it binds and internalizes oxidized LDL and microparticles, supplying lipid to promote foam cell formation. Platelet exosomes inhibited oxidized-LDL binding and cholesterol loading into macrophages. Exosomes were not competitive CD36 ligands, but instead sharply reduced total macrophage CD36 content. Exosomal proteins, in contrast to microparticle or cellular proteins, were highly adducted by ubiquitin. Exosomes enhanced ubiquitination of cellular proteins, including CD36, and blockade of proteosome proteolysis with MG-132 rescued CD36 expression. Recombinant unanchored K48 poly-ubiquitin behaved similarly to exosomes, inhibiting platelet function, macrophage CD36 expression and macrophage particle uptake.

Conclusions: Platelet-derived exosomes inhibit athero-thrombotic processes by reducing CD36-dependent lipid loading of macrophages and by suppressing platelet thrombosis. Exosomes increase protein ubiquitination and enhance proteasome degradation of CD36.

Keywords: CD36 protein; cell-derived microparticles; exosomes; platelets; thrombosis.

Abstract

Background: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) has 2 phenotypes: obstructive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS). Our goal was to define distinct immunologic markers of exosomes from LTxRs with BOS or RAS.

Methods: Plasma was collected from LTxRs with BOS (n = 18), RAS (n = 13), and from stable LTxRs (n = 5). Antibodies to lung self-antigens (SAgs) were determined by ELISA. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Donor specific antibodies to HLA were quantified using Luminex. Exosomes were characterized for lung SAgs, transcription factors, 20S proteasome, HLA class I and II, and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor protein using western blot. Exosome miRNA was analyzed using NanoString. The exosome-induced immune response was determined in mice.

Results: LTxRs with RAS, but not BOS, had donor specific antibodies at diagnosis. CIITA, NFkB, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor protein, 20S proteasome, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR were significantly higher in RAS exosomes than in BOS exosomes. RAS plasma had high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and distinct exosomal miRNA. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with RAS exosomes showed severe inflammation and peribronchial fibrosis, whereas BOS exosomes induced patchy inflammation and fibrosis.

Conclusion: LTxRs with BOS or RAS had exosomes with distinct molecular and immunologic profiles. RAS samples had a higher concentration of proinflammatory factors, HLA class II, lung SAgs, and antibodies to HLA class II molecules, indicating severe allograft injury. Mice immunized with RAS exosomes developed lesions in airways, pleura, interlobular septum, and alveoli, whereas BOS exosomes induced mild to patchy inflammation with lung fibrosis.

Abstract

Objectives: Exosomes are potent vehicles for intercellular communication. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease of unknown etiology. Local administration of miR-124 precursor to rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis suppresses systemic arthritis and bone destruction. Thus, exosomes may be involved in this disease. We aimed to determine the role of exosomes in the pathology of RA.

Methods: Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were collected from patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). miR-124-3p mimic was transfected into the RA FLS (RA miR-124 FLS). Exosomes were collected from the culture medium by ultracentrifugation. Macrophages were produced from THP-1 cells. MicroRNAs in the exosomes were analyzed using real-time PCR. Proteomics analysis was performed using nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Macrophage migration was evaluated using a Transwell migration assay. SiRNA was used to knockdown proteins of interest.

Results: MicroRNAs in the RA FLS, RA miR-124 FLS, and OA FLS exosomes were similar. Proteomics analysis revealed that pentraxin 3 (PTX3) levels were higher in RA FLS exosomes than in RA miR-124 FLS and OA FLS exosomes, and proteasome 20S subunit beta 5 (PSMB5) levels were lower in RA FLS exosomes than in RA miR-124 FLS and OA FLS exosomes. The RA FLS exosomes promoted and the RA miR-124 FLS exosomes suppressed macrophage migration. PTX3-silenced RA FLS exosomes suppressed and PSMB5-silenced OA FLS exosomes promoted macrophage migration.

Conclusions: RA FLS exosomes promote macrophage migration via PTX3 and PSMB5, and miR-124-3p suppresses this migration.

Abstract

Objective: Lung transplantation is therapeutic for end-stage lung disease, but survival is limited due to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and restrictive chronic lung allograft dysfunction. We sought a common denominator in lung transplant recipients, analyzing risk factors that trigger immune responses that lead to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.

Methods: We collected blood from patients who underwent lung transplant at our institution. Exosomes were isolated from the sera of recipients with risk factors for chronic rejection and from stable recipients. Exosomes were analyzed with western blot, using antibodies to lung self-antigens K alpha 1 tubulin and collagen-V, costimulatory molecules (costimulatory molecule 80, costimulatory molecule 86), transcription factors (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator), and 20S proteasome.

Results: Of the 90 patients included, we identified 5 with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, 5 without, 15 with respiratory viral infection, 10 with acute rejection, 10 with donor-specific antibodies (DSA), 5 without DSA, and 10 who were stable for exosome isolation. Recipients with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, respiratory viral infection, acute rejection, and DSA had exosomes containing self-antigens; exosomes from stable recipients did not. Exosomes from recipients with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, acute rejection, and DSA also demonstrated costimulatory molecule 80, costimulatory molecule 86, major histocompatibility complex class II, transcription factor, and 20S proteasome.

Conclusions: Transplanted lungs with grade 3 primary graft dysfunction, symptomatic respiratory viral infection, acute rejection, and immune responses induce exosomes that contain self-antigens, costimulatory molecules, major histocompatibility complex class II, transcription factors, and 20S proteasome. Release of circulating exosomes post-transplant from the aforementioned stress-inducing insults augment immunity and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.

Keywords: DSA; acute rejection; circulatory exosomes; lung transplant; novel mechanism; primary graft dysfunction; rejection.

Abstract

Metastasis is the most lethal stage of cancer progression. The present study aimed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of melanoma metastasis using bioinformatics. Using the microarray dataset GSE8401 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included 52 biopsy specimens from patients with melanoma metastasis and 31 biopsy specimens from patients with primary melanoma, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, subsequent to data preprocessing with the affy package, followed by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. A protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Mutated genes were analyzed with 80 mutated cases with melanoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The overall survival of key candidate DEGs, which were within a filtering of degree >30 criteria in the PPI network and involved three or more KEGG signaling pathways, and genes with a high mutation frequency were delineated. The expression analysis of key candidate DEGs, mutant genes and their associated genes were performed on UALCAN. Of the 1,187 DEGs obtained, 505 were upregulated and 682 were downregulated. 'Extracellular exosome' processes, the 'amoebiasis' pathway, the 'ECM‑receptor interaction' pathway and the 'focal adhesion' signaling pathway were significantly enriched and identified as important processes or signaling pathways. The overall survival analysis of phosphoinositide‑3‑kinase regulator subunit 3 (PIK3R3), centromere protein M (CENPM), aurora kinase A (AURKA), laminin subunit α 1 (LAMA1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1), BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase (BUB1), NDC80 kinetochore complex component (NDC80) and protein kinase C α (PRKCA) in DEGs was statistically significant. Mutation gene analysis identified that BRCA1‑associated protein 1 (BAP1) had a higher mutation frequency and survival analysis, and its associated genes in the BAP1‑associated PPI network, including ASXL transcriptional regulator 1 (ASXL1), proteasome 26S subunit, non‑ATPase 3 (PSMD3), proteasome 26S subunit, non ATPase 11 (PSMD11) and ubiquitin C (UBC), were statistically significantly associated with the overall survival of patients with melanoma. The expression levels of PRKCA, BUB1, BAP1 and ASXL1 were significantly different between primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma. Based on the present study, 'extracellular exosome' processes, 'amoebiasis' pathways, 'ECM‑receptor interaction' pathways and 'focal adhesion' signaling pathways may be important in the formation of metastases from melanoma. The involved genes, including PIK3R3, CENPM, AURKA, LAMA1, PCNA, ADCY1, BUB1, NDC80 and PRKCA, and mutation associated genes, including BAP1, ASXL1, PSMD3, PSMD11 and UBC, may serve important roles in metastases of melanoma.

Abstract

Proteasome-mediated proteolysis is important for many basic cellular processes. In addition to their functions in the cell, proteasomes have been found in physiological fluids of both healthy and diseased humans including cancer patients. Higher levels of these proteasomes are associated with higher cancer burden and stage. The etiology and functions of these proteasomes, referred to as circulating, plasmatic, or extracellular proteasomes (ex-PSs), are unclear. Here we show that human cancer cell lines, as well as human endometrium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMESCs), release proteasome complexes into culture medium (CM). To define ex-PS composition, we have affinity purified them from CM conditioned by human leukemia cell line K562. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS), we have identified core 20S proteasome subunits and a set of 15 proteasome-interacting proteins (PIPs), all previously described as exosome cargo proteins. Three of them, PPIase A, aldolase A, and transferrin, have never been reported as PIPs. The study provides compelling arguments that ex-PSs do not contain 19S or PA200 regulatory particles and are represented exclusively by the 20S complex.

Keywords: affinity purification; extracellular proteasome; human leukemia K562 cells; mass spectrometry; proteasome interacting protein (PIP).

Abstract

Background: Clinical management of metastatic gastric cancer (mGC) remains a major challenge due to a lack of specific biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets. Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that exosomes play an essential role in cancer metastasis and can be an excellent reservoir of novel biomarkers and candidate therapeutic targets for cancer. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to reveal the proteomic profile of mGC-derived exosomes. Methods: Exosomes were isolated from pooled serum samples of 20 mGC patients and 40 healthy controls (HC) by ultracentrifugation. Next, quantitative proteomic analyses were applied to analyze the protein profiles of the exosomes, and bioinformatic analyses were conducted on the proteomic data. Finally, the expression of exosomal protein candidates was selectively validated in individual subjects by western blot analysis. Results: We isolated exosomes from serum samples. The size of the serum derived exosomes ranged from 30 to 150 nm in diameter. The exosomal markers CD9 and CD81 were observed in the serum exosomes. However, the exosomal negative marker calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum protein, was not detected in exosomes. Overall, 443 exosomal proteins, including 110 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified by quantitative proteomics analyses. The bioinformatics analyses indicated that the upregulated proteins were enriched in the process of protein metabolic, whereas the downregulated proteins were largely involved in cell-cell adhesion organization. Surprisingly, 10 highly vital proteins (UBA52, PSMA1, PSMA5, PSMB6, PSMA7, PSMA4, PSMA3, PSMB1, PSMA6, and FGA) were filtered from DEPs, most of which are proteasome subunits. Moreover, the validation data confirmed that PSMA3 and PSMA6 were explicitly enriched in the serum derived exosomes from patients with mGC. Conclusion: The present study provided a comprehensive description of the serum exosome proteome of mGC patients, which could be an excellent resource for further studies of mGC.

Abstract

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intestinal immune-dysfunctional disease worldwide whose prevalence increasing in Asia including China. It is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract with unknown cause. Exosomes are small vesicles in various body fluids. They have diameters of 40-120 nm, and one of their functions is long-distance transfer of various substances. In this study, we investigated the contents of salivary exosomes in patients with IBD and in healthy controls to explore a new biomarker in patients with IBD. In this study, whole saliva was obtained from patients with IBD (ulcerative colitis (UC), n = 37; Crohn's disease (CD), n = 11) and apparently healthy individuals (HC, n = 10). Salivary exosomes were extracted from samples, and the proteins within the exosomes were identified by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). The results showed that more than 2000 proteins were detected in salivary exosomes from patients with IBD. Through gene ontology analysis, we found that proteasome subunit alpha type 7 (PSMA7) showed especially marked differences between patients with IBD and the healthy controls, in that its expression level was much higher in the CD and UC groups. This exosomal protein is related to proteasome activity and inflammatory responses. So we conclude that in this research, salivary exosomal PSMA7 was present at high levels in salivary exosomes from subjects with IBD. It can be a very promising biomarker to release the patients from the pain of colonoscopy.

Abstract

Background: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The study of urinary exosomal proteins might provide insight into the pathophysiology of CF kidney disease. Methods: Urine samples were collected from 19 CF patients (among those 7 were treated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators), and 8 healthy subjects. Urine exosomal protein content was determined by high resolution mass spectrometry. Results: A heatmap of the differentially expressed proteins in urinary exosomes showed a clear separation between control and CF patients. Seventeen proteins were upregulated in CF patients (including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); proteasome subunit beta type-6, transglutaminases, caspase 14) and 118 were downregulated (including glutathione S-transferases, superoxide dismutase, klotho, endosomal sorting complex required for transport, and matrisome proteins). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed 20 gene sets upregulated and 74 downregulated. Treatment with CFTR modulators yielded no significant modification of the proteomic content. These results highlight that CF kidney cells adapt to the CFTR defect by upregulating proteasome activity and that autophagy and endosomal targeting are impaired. Increased expression of EGFR and decreased expression of klotho and matrisome might play a central role in this CF kidney signature by inducing oxidation, inflammation, accelerated senescence, and abnormal tissue repair. Conclusions: Our study unravels novel insights into consequences of CFTR dysfunction in the urinary tract, some of which may have clinical and therapeutic implications.

Abstract

As an example of the burgeoning importance of stem cell therapy, this past month the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) has approved $70 million to create a new network of stem cell clinical trial centers. Much work in the last decade has been devoted to developing the use of autologous and allogeneic adult stem cell transplants to treat a number of conditions, including heart attack, dementia, wounds, and immune system-related diseases. The standard model teaches us that adult stem cells exists throughout most of the body and provide a means to regenerate and repair most tissues through replication and differentiation. Although we have often witnessed the medical cart placed in front of the scientific horse in the development of stem cell therapies outside of academic circles, great strides have been made, such as the use of purified stem cells(1) instead of whole bone marrow transplants in cancer patients, where physicians avoid re-injecting the patients with their own cancer cells.(2) We most often think of stem cell therapy acting to regenerate tissue through replication and then differentiation, but recent studies point to the dramatic effects adult stem cells exert in the repair of various tissues through the release of paracrine and autocrine substances, and not simply through differentiation. Indeed, up to 80% of the therapeutic effect of adult stem cells has been shown to be through paracrine mediated actions.(3) That is, the collected types of molecules released by the stem cells, called the secretome, or stem cell released molecules (SRM), number in the 100s, including proteins, microRNA, growth factors, antioxidants, proteasomes, and exosomes, and target a multitude of biological pathways through paracrine actions. The composition of the different molecule types in SRM is state dependent, and varies with cell type and conditions such as age and environment.

Abstract

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a selective loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the human midbrain causing motor dysfunctions. The exact mechanism behind dopaminergic cell death is still not completely understood and, so far, no cure or neuroprotective treatment for PD is available. Recent studies have brought attention to the variety of bioactive molecules produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), generally referred to as the secretome. Herein, we evaluated whether human MSCs-bone marrow derived (hBMSCs) secretome would be beneficial in a PD pre-clinical model, when compared directly with cell transplantation of hBMSCs alone. We used a 6-hydroxydpomanie (6-OHDA) rat PD model, and motor behavior was evaluated at different time points after treatments (1, 4, and 7 weeks). The impact of the treatments in the recovery of DA neurons was estimated by determining TH-positive neuronal densities in the substantia nigra and fibers in the striatum, respectively, at the end of the behavioral characterization. Furthermore, we determined the effect of the hBMSCs secretome on the neuronal survival of human neural progenitors in vitro, and characterized the secretome through proteomic-based approaches. This work demonstrates that the injection of hBMSCs secretome led to the rescue of DA neurons, when compared to transplantation of hBMSCs themselves, which can explain the recovery of secretome-injected animals' behavioral performance in the staircase test. Moreover, we observed that hBMSCs secretome induces higher levels of in vitro neuronal differentiation. Finally, the proteomic analysis revealed that hBMSCs secrete important exosome-related molecules, such as those related with the ubiquitin-proteasome and histone systems. Overall, this work provided important insights on the potential use of hBMSCs secretome as a therapeutic tool for PD, and further confirms the importance of the secreted molecules rather than the transplantation of hBMSCs for the observed positive effects. These could be likely through normalization of defective processes in PD, namely proteostasis or altered gene transcription, which lately can lead to neuroprotective effects.

Abstract

Exosomes have recently appeared as a novel source of non-invasive cancer biomarkers since tumour-specific molecules can be found in exosomes isolated from biological fluids. We have here investigated the proteome of urinary exosomes by using mass spectrometry to identify proteins differentially expressed in prostate cancer patients compared to healthy male controls. In total, 15 control and 16 prostate cancer samples of urinary exosomes were analyzed. Importantly, 246 proteins were differentially expressed in the two groups. The majority of these proteins (221) were up-regulated in exosomes from prostate cancer patients. These proteins were analyzed according to specific criteria to create a focus list that contained 37 proteins. At 100% specificity, 17 of these proteins displayed individual sensitivities above 60%. Even though several of these proteins showed high sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer as individual biomarkers, combining them in a multi-panel test has the potential for full differentiation of prostate cancer from non-disease controls. The highest sensitivity, 94%, was observed for transmembrane protein 256 (TM256; chromosome 17 open reading frame 61). LAMTOR proteins were also distinctly enriched with very high specificity for patient samples. TM256 and LAMTOR1 could be used to augment the sensitivity to 100%. Other prominent proteins were V-type proton ATPase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit (VATL), adipogenesis regulatory factor (ADIRF), and several Rab-class members and proteasomal proteins. In conclusion, this study clearly shows the potential of using urinary exosomes in the diagnosis and clinical management of prostate cancer.

Abstract

: During chronic liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) undergo activation and are the principal cellular source of collagenous scar. In this study, we found that activation of mouse HSC (mHSC) was associated with a 4.5-fold increase in extracellular vesicle (EV) production and that fibrogenic gene expression (CCN2, Col1a1) was suppressed in Passage 1 (P1; activated) mHSC exposed to EVs from Day 4 (D4; relatively quiescent) mHSC but not to EVs from P1 mHSC. Conversely, gene expression (CCN2, Col1a1, αSMA) in D4 mHSC was stimulated by EVs from P1 mHSC but not by EVs from D4 mHSC. EVs from Day 4 mHSC contained only 46 proteins in which histones and keratins predominated, while EVs from P1 mHSC contained 337 proteins and these were principally associated with extracellular spaces or matrix, proteasome, collagens, vesicular transport, metabolic enzymes, ribosomes and chaperones. EVs from the activated LX-2 human HSC (hHSC) line also promoted fibrogenic gene expression in D4 mHSC in vitro and contained 524 proteins, many of which shared identity or had functional overlap with those in P1 mHSC EVs. The activation-associated changes in production, function and protein content of EVs from HSC likely contribute to the regulation of HSC function in vivo and to the fine-tuning of fibrogenic pathways in the liver.

Abstract

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes dehydration of the surface of the airways, increasing lung infections, most frequently caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Exosomes are nanovesicles released by cells that play an essential role in intercellular communication, although their role during bacterial infections is not well understood. In this article, we analyze the alterations in exosomes produced by healthy bronchial epithelial and cystic fibrosis cell lines caused by the interaction with P. aeruginosa. The proteomic study detected alterations in 30% of the species analyzed. In healthy cells, they mainly involve proteins related to the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton, and various catabolic enzymes. In CF, proteins related to the cytoskeleton and matrix, in addition to the proteasome. These differences could be related to the inflammatory response. A study of miRNAs detected alterations in 18% of the species analyzed. The prediction of their potential biological targets identified 7149 genes, regulated by up to 7 different miRNAs. The identification of their functions showed that they preferentially affected molecules involved in binding and catalytic activities, although with differences between cell types. In conclusion, this study shows differences in exosomes between CF and healthy cells that could be involved in the response to infection.

Abstract

Background: Because of the increasing life expectancy in our society, aging-related neurodegenerative disorders are one of the main issues in global health. Most of these diseases are characterized by the deposition of misfolded proteins and a progressive cognitive decline. Among these diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are the most common types of degenerative dementia. Although both show specific features, an important neuropathological and clinical overlap between them hampers their correct diagnosis. In this work, we identified molecular biomarkers aiming to improve the misdiagnosis between both diseases.

Methods: Plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) -from DLB, AD and healthy controls- were isolated using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and characterized by flow cytometry, Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) and cryo-electron microscopy. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and related bibliographic search was performed and a selected group of EV-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) was analysed by qPCR.

Results: Results uncovered two miRNAs (hsa-miR-451a and hsa-miR-21-5p) significantly down-regulated in AD samples respect to DLB patients, and a set of four miRNAs (hsa-miR-23a-3p, hsa-miR-126-3p, hsa-let-7i-5p, and hsa-miR-151a-3p) significantly decreased in AD respect to controls. The two miRNAs showing decreased expression in AD in comparison to DLB provided area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.9 in ROC curve analysis, thus suggesting their possible use as biomarkers to discriminate between both diseases. Target gene analysis of these miRNAs using prediction online tools showed accumulation of phosphorylation enzymes, presence of proteasome-related proteins and genes involved in cell death among others.

Conclusion: Our data suggest that plasma-EV associated miRNAs may reflect a differential profile for a given dementia-related disorder which, once validated in larger cohorts of patients, could help to improve the differential diagnosis of DLB versus AD.

Abstract

Background: Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles 30-200 nm in diameter secreted from cells, which contain functional mRNAs and microRNAs. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the primary source for liquid biopsy to examine diseases in central nervous system. To date, there is no available method to analyze exosomal mRNAs comprehensively in human CSF.

Methods: The main purpose of this study is to established the methodology of comprehensive analysis of exosomal mRNAs in CSF by a highly sensitive next-generation sequencing. The signatures of CSF exosomal mRNAs were then compared between four normal healthy donors and four sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients to identify disease-related biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes were identified by DESeq2.

Results: RNA sequencing from CSF exosomes was successfully performed, that was demonstrated by the high pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (r = 0.993) in the technical replicates. Also, position coverage analysis revealed that most detected mRNAs retained their integrity throughout their full-length in CSF exosomes. In CSF exosomes from normal healthy donors, an average of 14,807 genes were detected, of which 4580 genes were commonly detected among four individuals, including neuron-enriched genes such as TUBB3 and CAMK2A. In comparison with exosomal mRNAs in CSF from four patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 543 genes were significantly changed, as represented by CUEDC2. Gene Ontology analysis and pathway analysis with these genes revealed functional enrichment of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, oxidative stress response, and unfolded protein response. These pathways are related to pathomechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Conclusion: We successfully established the methodology of comprehensive analysis of exosomal mRNAs in human CSF. It was shown to be useful to identify disease biomarkers for central nervous system. Several genes, such as CUEDC2, in CSF exosomes were suggested to be candidate disease biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
